<img src="src/images/1.png">

* First you will want to log in with any `username` from `customer1` to `customer50`.
The `password` will always be `overlook2021`.

* On the left you will see a list of bookings that your user already has. On the
 right side you will see a calendar. If you click on the icon, you will be prompted
 to pick a date, or if you're feelin' it, you can enter your own date manually.

* A list of available rooms for that date should appear with radio buttons. You
may click the radio button of your choosing that is associated with a room that you
would like to reserve, or you may filter the room list by the room type that you
prefer.

* After selecting a room, you can hit the `Book it!` button, and it will add it
to your list of already existing room bookings! How exciting!

### Future Additions

* Scroll bar and button redesign
* Add Images, and make rooms into visual cards
* Replace radio buttons with actual buttons
